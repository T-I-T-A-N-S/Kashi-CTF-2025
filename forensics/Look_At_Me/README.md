## Writeup

On carefully seeing the image, I found various black dots visible in the picture so I tried to search for the original image and while doing so I found *SilentEye: cross-platform application design for an easy use of steganography*. I downlaoded the tool and uploaded the picture and DECODE and there was the flag.
