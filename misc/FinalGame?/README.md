## WriteUp

I  had done a similar challenge before and knew that this one was also related to *Chess Steganography*. So I directly copied the *PGN (Portable Game Notation: is a plain-text format for recording chess games)* and used [https://incoherency.co.uk/chess-steg/](https://incoherency.co.uk/chess-steg/) to decode the flag.
