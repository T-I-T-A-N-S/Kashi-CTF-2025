### Step 1: Searching for the Street

As the language wasn't familiar to me so I decided to search for the country first and thus, searched for the politicians whose posters were there (*Dr. TATAR* and *DONATH ANNA*) and found the country to be *HUNGARY*.

 
After some research I found the street named *Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Ãºt* and to confirm I used [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/search/Duna+House+near+Budapest,+Bajcsy-Zsilinszky+%c3%bat,+Hungary/@47.50327098,19.05506542,105.85079889a,0d,60y,66.20180559h,85t,0r/data=CqcBGnkScwolMHg0NzQxZGM3Yjk5MmUwZmFkOjB4N2I3NGU5NDJlZWQ1OTEzYRle2QWDa8BHQCH4_ZsXJw4zQCo4RHVuYSBIb3VzZSBuZWFyIEJ1ZGFwZXN0LCBCYWpjc3ktWnNpbGluc3preSDDunQsIEh1bmdhcnkYASABIiYKJAmnJf8Q6MBHQBF0EHmWbsBHQBk86yG-YQ8zQCEUUgvcxwwzQEICCAEiGgoWTFo5NGd3LXhEdVdIeXZ4QlF2amM3ZxACOgMKATBCAggASg0I____________ARAA) and found the exact location and was thus  confirmed.

### Step 2: Retrievel of Flag

I searched for the politician and found *Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky* and converting it to the required format gives.
